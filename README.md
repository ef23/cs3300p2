# 3300 Project 2 - Global Greenhouse Gases
**A dynamic visualization of increasing global emissions**

Members: Hanna Arfine, Eric Feng, Ryan Yoon

This is the second project for Cornell's [CS/INFO3300](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/info3300/). The data for this project was primarily pulled from [WRI](https://cait.wri.org). The visualization allows you to interact with it through a heatmap with a year slider, which will update the heatmap accordingly, as well as allowing users to hover over individual countries' emissions over time. There is also a scatterplot page that correlates emissions to various variables.

This project primarily used D3.js to generate the data visualizations.
